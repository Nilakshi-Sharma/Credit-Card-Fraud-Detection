# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions and protect users from financial loss. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, this system analyses transaction data to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. 
Key Features:
1. Data Preprocessing:

2. Cleans and normalizes transaction data.
Handles missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering:

3.Extracts relevant features from raw data.
Creates new features that enhance the predictive power of the model.
Machine Learning Model:

4. Employs supervised learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Trains the model on a labeled dataset containing known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Model Evaluation:

5. Evaluates the model using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
Performs cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.
Real-Time Fraud Detection:

6. Deploys the trained model to analyze real-time transaction data.
Flags suspicious transactions for further review.
User Interface:

7. Provides a user-friendly interface for reviewing flagged transactions.
Allows users to approve or reject transactions, and update the system with feedback to improve future detection.
Reporting and Analytics:

8. Generates reports on detection accuracy, false positives, and false negatives.
Provides insights into transaction patterns and trends.
How to Run the Project:
This project is designed to run from the terminal using Streamlit, a powerful and easy-to-use web application framework for machine learning and data science projects. To start the Credit Card Fraud Detection System, open your terminal and execute the following command:
streamlit run main.py
This command launches the Streamlit web application, providing an interactive interface to visualize and interact with the fraud detection system. Users can upload transaction data, view real-time detection results, and access various analytical tools provided by the system.
